DynamicRocket

I created this project just for fun.

It was a idea and i would create something new to manage servers. Unfortunately DynamicRocket only can start servers
with register them in the bungee config.yml. A bug prohibits that I cannot register the server as a
fallback server (=> SpigotMC.org Thread -> https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/which-path-is-this.342690/)

I pushed this code, that other programmers can use this code for their own projects - The principle of GitHub.
Maybe someone will do more with it...?! As well the code doesn't really works I wanna show you how hard I worked
the last weeks. You can find the java docs in this projects too.

I will work in the next days a lot on this projects, but I must do a lot else.

Happy coding ^^
